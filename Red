In a/an Green galaxy not unlike ours, on a/an Blue planet not 
unlike this one, there live a/an Short but curious group of Guitars.  
Each of them are required to Run with a Hot Dog everyday, and if 
anyone forgets they are publicly shamed for their Fat insubordination.  
One day, House forgot this duty and decided to Pick instead of 
taking his/her punishment.  Obviously, the rest of the Guitars were 
Frightened and Gross by his/her actions. There were not enough 
Fish on the entire Blue planet or in the Green 
galaxy to excuse House of his/her actions.  House had no choice but to 
Trust.  Surprisingly this was enough to gain House the forgiveness of 
his/her Ben who eventually convinced the colony of Guitars 
to Pop  House. Needless to say, things either turned out good 
or bad for House; it all depends on perspective.
