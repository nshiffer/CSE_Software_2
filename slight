Once upon a time there was a/an Tall Plumber who sought the aid of a/an
Distilled Zoo Keeper to help her escape from the dreadful House
she has been locked in for the past 3000000000 8. Finally after
several newspaper ads and a couple of smoke signals the Distilled 
Zoo Keeper Jump his way past the fire breathing dragon, through the 
4848484 foot deep moat, and up the Old tower.  At last the Tall 
Plumber was saved and the couple was free to live Slightly ever after.
