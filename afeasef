One asdfasdf autumn morning, asdfsasdf took a/an asdfasdf for a walk. 
Because asdfsasdf was late for asdfasdf, he/she asdfasdf 
all the way to the asdfasdf. On the way there asdfsasdf passed
through the asdfasfd where he/she saw a/an asdfasdf, but excited Brutus. 
asdfsasdf also saw a large, asdfasdf group of asdfasdf, playing asdfasdf.
When  asdfsasdf arrived at the asdfasdf, he/she realized it was Friday
and he/she didn't have asdfasdf today.
