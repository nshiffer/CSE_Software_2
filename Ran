One Purple autumn morning, Balloon took a/an Cat for a walk. 
Because Balloon was late for Pottery, he/she Ran 
all the way to the Mars. On the way there Balloon passed
through the Thompson where he/she saw a/an Tall, but excited Brutus. 
Balloon also saw a large, Golden group of Rugs, playing Soccer.
When  Balloon arrived at the Mars, he/she realized it was Friday
and he/she didn't have Pottery today.
