One Purple autumn morning, Spaceship took a/an Anteater for a walk. 
Because Spaceship was late for Art History, he/she Swam 
all the way to the Austrailia. On the way there Spaceship passed
through the Hitchcock where he/she saw a/an Tall, but excited Brutus. 
Spaceship also saw a large, Bright group of Hospitals, playing Soccer.
When  Spaceship arrived at the Austrailia, he/she realized it was Friday
and he/she didn't have Art History today.
