In a/an Sleepy galaxy not unlike ours, on a/an Blue planet not 
unlike this one, there live a/an Red but curious group of hands.  
Each of them are required to bring with a Steak everyday, and if 
anyone forgets they are publicly shamed for their Scary insubordination.  
One day, Friend forgot this duty and decided to Teach instead of 
taking his/her punishment.  Obviously, the rest of the hands were 
Trusting and Friendly by his/her actions. There were not enough 
Grapes on the entire Blue planet or in the Sleepy 
galaxy to excuse Friend of his/her actions.  Friend had no choice but to 
Jump.  Surprisingly this was enough to gain Friend the forgiveness of 
his/her Ben who eventually convinced the colony of hands 
to swim  Friend. Needless to say, things either turned out good 
or bad for Friend; it all depends on perspective.
